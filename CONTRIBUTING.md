### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

* Maintain Flutter MCP's quality
* Fix problems that are important to users
* Engage the community in working toward the best possible Flutter MCP
* Enable a sustainable system for Flutter MCP's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in the [pull request template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides).
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides
